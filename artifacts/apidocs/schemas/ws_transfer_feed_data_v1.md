    |selector<br>`s1` |string|True|Primary selector|
    |sequence_number<br>`sn` |string|True|A sequence number used to determine message order within a stream.<br>- If `useGlobalSequenceNumber` is **false**, this returns the gateway sequence number, which increments by one locally within each stream and resets on gateway restarts.<br>- If `useGlobalSequenceNumber` is **true**, this returns the global sequence number, which uniquely identifies messages across the cluster.<br>  - A single cluster payload can be multiplexed into multiple stream payloads.<br>  - To distinguish each stream payload, a `dedupCounter` is included.<br>  - The returned sequence number is computed as: `cluster_sequence_number * 10^5 + dedupCounter`.|
    |feed<br>`f` |TransferHistory|True|The transfer history matching the requested filters|
