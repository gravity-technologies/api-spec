!!! info "[ApiSettlementPriceRequest](/../../schemas/api_settlement_price_request)"
    Lookup the historical settlement price of various pairs.<br><br>Pagination works as follows:<ul><li>We perform a reverse chronological lookup, starting from `end_time`. If `end_time` is not set, we start from the most recent data.</li><li>The lookup is limited to `limit` records. If more data is requested, the response will contain a `next` cursor for you to query the next page.</li><li>If a `cursor` is provided, it will be used to fetch results from that point onwards.</li><li>Pagination will continue until the `start_time` is reached. If `start_time` is not set, pagination will continue as far back as our data retention policy allows.</li></ul><br>
